#App Description

- Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing the website?


- What kind of information will the users be viewing? If you're drawing data form an external source (a csv file or an API), include a link and citation to that data.


- If you insist on using an API, confirm that you'll be able to access it from a client-side app by testing it at https://joelwross.github.io/cors-test/ (Links to an external site.). If you can't get data back from this testing site, then it won't work with your project.


- What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interaction are you expecting to provide? Note that your app will need to support one interactive feature per team member (minimum 2); be sure to explain what all all of them are!
How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a solution to the problem you described?


In such a post-pandemic world with all the ongoing turmoils, everyone is subject to unstable mental states and even illness. Our application aims to provide verified mental and psychological information to anyone who seeks aid. The mental health issues are as serious as physical illness however most people do not treat it as such. The main goal of our application is to help people realize the importance of mental well-being and point them to correct and up to date information before severe problems occur.

Our application is mainly an "index" to related psychological and mental health related information. Thus the first interactive feature we plan to implement is the search. Users should be able to look up topics they are interested in to find related articles. Secondly, we plan to implement a survey that based on the book _Diagnostic And Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition_ to provide a prelimanery diagnosis to the user. The manual is published by the American Psychiatric Association and serves as the principal authority for psychiatric diagnoses. It is also used globally by many other countries as reference. Then, we would give advises to the user according to the result of survey and would provide nearest therpyists and doctors information if needed. Last but not least, we plan to have an interactive data tool that shows data we collected reflecting on going situation of mental health of the users.
