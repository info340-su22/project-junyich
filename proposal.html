            <h3>What is the Problem</h3>
            <p>On social media and on online platforms, information is constantly being disseminated at an alarming rate. There is a vast amount of posts being shared daily, causing us to barely comprehend the spread and amount of information online. With so much available on the Internet, there are numerous resources that are accessible. Because of the Internet, users can schedule appointments online, contact their doctors or physicians through an app, and learn more about conditions or ailments. However, the apps and information available for mental health are not as trustworthy as we want them to be or adequate enough to support users.</p>

            <h3>Why the Problem Needs Addressing</h3>
            <p>The issue that we want to address is the potential harm of unverified information about mental health on social media and on the Internet. There are an abundance of apps that allow users to take surveys to learn whether they may have a particular condition or not. However, most of these surveys are notcredible â€“ they do not rely on certified sources, but merely on information from the Internet. Websites like <a href="https://psychcentral.com/" target="_blank"> PsychCentral</a>, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us" target="_blank"> Psychology Today</a>, and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/" target="_blank"> Talk Space</a> have surveys for users to take, but the questions are typically too obvious (and are leading at times) and are not backed by any source.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Our_Goal">
            <h3>Our Goal</h3>
            <p>To prevent unnecessary worry and ensure more credible tests, we aim to create an application that takes information from the DSM-5 and curates questions that are not leading or too obvious to diagnose. After all, our intentions of these tests are to spark awareness and lead users to other resources instead of diagnosing too easily or encouraging answers. Additionally, users will feel more confident knowing that their tests come from a source that is credible and verified.</p>

            <h3>Description of Web Application</h3>
            <p>In such a post-pandemic world with the ongoing turmoils, everyone is subject to unstable mental states and even illness. Our application aims to provide verified mental and psychological information to anyone who seeks aid. Mental health issues are as severe as physical illness. However, most people do not treat them as such. The main goal of our application is to help people realize the importance of mental well-being and point them to correct and up-to-date information before severe problems occur.</p>
            <p>Our application is mainly an "index" to related psychological and mental health-related information. Thus, there are <strong>several interactive features</strong> we plan to implement.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p class="strong">Navigation buttons and indexs</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first interactive feature we plan to implement is the index.</li>
                        <li>"Buttons" that lead users to explore topic they are interested in such as anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorder and etc.</li>
                        <li>These buttons would naviagte people to articles and information published by genuine psychologists and therapists.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="strong">Diagnosis Survey</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Second, we plan to implement a survey based on the book <a href="http://repository.poltekkes-kaltim.ac.id/657/1/Diagnostic%20and%20statistical%20manual%20of%20mental%20disorders%20_%20DSM-5%20%28%20PDFDrive.com%20%29.pdf"> <cite>Diagnostic And Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition</cite></a> to provide a preliminary diagnosis to the user.</li>
                        <li>The manual is published by the American Psychiatric Association and serves as the principal authority for psychiatric diagnoses.</li>
                        <li>It is also used globally by many other countries as a reference.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="strong">Book exhibition</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Third, we plan to have a gallery of books about mental health and psychology</li>
                        <li>Users can filter the books by its topic</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="strong">Lifestyle Management</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lastly, we want to help users to build up healther Lifestyle that could alleviate them from the stress of unstable mental states.</li>
                        <li>Users can create their own profiles and record activities and set up remainders.</li>
                        <li>We would have a list of recommanded activites such as meditation, yoga, and take a deep breath.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
