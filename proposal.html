            <h3>What is the Problem</h3>
            <p>On social media and on online platforms, information is constantly being disseminated at an alarming
                rate. There is a vast amount of posts being shared daily, causing us to barely comprehend the spread and
                amount of information online. With so much available on the Internet, there are numerous resources that
                are accessible. Because of the Internet, users can schedule appointments online, contact their doctors
                or physicians through an app, and learn more about conditions or ailments. However, the apps and
                information available for mental health are not as trustworthy as we want them to be or adequate enough
                to support users.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Why the Problem Needs Addressing">
            <h3>Why the Problem Needs Addressing</h3>
            <p>The issue that we want to address is the potential harm of unverified information about mental health on
                social media and on the Internet. There are an abundance of apps that allow users to take surveys to
                learn whether they may have a particular condition or not. However, most of these surveys are not
                credible â€“ they do not rely on certified sources, but merely on information from the Internet. Websites
                like <a href="https://psychcentral.com/" target="_blank">
                    PsychCentral</a>, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us" target="_blank">
                    Psychology Today</a>, and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/" target="_blank">
                    Talk Space</a> have surveys for users to take, but the
                questions are typically too obvious (and are leading at times) and are not backed by any source.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Our Goal">
            <h3>Our Goal</h3>
            <p>To prevent unnecessary worry and ensure more credible tests, we aim to create an application that takes
                information from the DSM-5 and curates questions that are not leading or too obvious to diagnose. After
                all, our intentions of these tests are to spark awareness and lead users to other resources instead of
                diagnosing too easily or encouraging answers. Additionally, users will feel more confident knowing that
                their tests come from a source that is credible and verified.</p>

        <section id="Description of the Application">
            <h3>Description of Web Application</h3>
            <p>In such a post-pandemic world with the ongoing turmoils, everyone
                is subject to unstable mental states and even illness. Our
                application aims to provide verified mental and psychological
                information to anyone who seeks aid. Mental health issues are as
                severe as physical illness. However, most people do not treat them
                as such. The main goal of our application is to help people realize
                the importance of mental well-being and point them to correct and
                up-to-date information before severe problems occur.</p>
            <p>
                Our application is mainly an "index" to related psychological and
                mental health-related information. Thus, there are <strong>several
                    interactive features</strong> we plan to implement.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li class="strong">Search</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first interactive feature we plan to implement is the search.</li>
                    <li>Users should be able to look up topics they are interested in to
                        find related articles.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="strong">Diagnosis Survey</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Second, we plan to implement a survey based on the book
                        <a
                            href="http://repository.poltekkes-kaltim.ac.id/657/1/Diagnostic%20and%20statistical%20manual%20of%20mental%20disorders%20_%20DSM-5%20%28%20PDFDrive.com%20%29.pdf">
                            <cite>Diagnostic And Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition</cite></a>
                        to provide a preliminary diagnosis to the user.
                    </li>
                    <li>The manual is published by the American Psychiatric Association
                        and serves as the principal authority for psychiatric diagnoses.</li>
                    <li>It is also used globally by many other countries as a reference.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="strong">Advice to Experts</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Third, we would give advice to the user according to the result of the survey.</li>
                    <li>Our website would provide the nearest therapists' and doctors' information if needed.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="strong">Interactive Data Tool</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lastly, we plan to have an interactive data tool that shows data we collected reflecting
                        the ongoing situation of the mental health of the users.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
