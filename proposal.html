            <h3>Description of Web Application</h3>
            <p>In such a post-pandemic world with the ongoing turmoils, everyone 
                is subject to unstable mental states and even illness. Our 
                application aims to provide verified mental and psychological 
                information to anyone who seeks aid. Mental health issues are as 
                severe as physical illness. However, most people do not treat them 
                as such. The main goal of our application is to help people realize 
                the importance of mental well-being and point them to correct and 
                up-to-date information before severe problems occur.</p>
            <p>
                Our application is mainly an "index" to related psychological and 
                mental health-related information. Thus, there are <strong>several  
                interactive features</strong> we plan to implement. 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Search</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first interactive feature we plan to implement is the search.</li>
                        <li>Users should be able to look up topics they are interested in to 
                            find related articles.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Diagnosis Survey</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Second, we plan to implement a survey based on the book 
                            <a href="http://repository.poltekkes-kaltim.ac.id/657/1/Diagnostic%20and%20statistical%20manual%20of%20mental%20disorders%20_%20DSM-5%20%28%20PDFDrive.com%20%29.pdf">
                                Diagnostic And Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition</a>
                            to provide a preliminary diagnosis to the user.</li>
                        <li>The manual is published by the American Psychiatric Association 
                            and serves as the principal authority for psychiatric diagnoses.</li>
                        <li>It is also used globally by many other countries as a reference.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Advice to Experts</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Third, we would give advice to the user according to the result of the survey.</li>
                        <li>Our website would provide the nearest therapists' and doctors' information if needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Interactive Data Tool</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lastly, we plan to have an interactive data tool that shows data we collected reflecting
                            the ongoing situation of the mental health of the users.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ol>
